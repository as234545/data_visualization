# Data Visualization of Flight Delays and Cancellations


Project Description
------------------
In this project, I create visualizations to reveal insights from  Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset. also I created data visualizations that highlight patterns in the data set. the work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.


 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset
